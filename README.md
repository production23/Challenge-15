# Earthquake Visualization

### This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet and D3.js, providing an interactive and informative way to explore seismic activity around the globe. The map displays earthquake markers that vary in size based on their magnitude and in color based on their depth, offering a clear and intuitive representation of the data.

# Features
### Interactive Map: Navigate and zoom to different regions to explore earthquake activity in detail.
# Earthquake Markers:
## Size by Magnitude: Larger markers represent stronger earthquakes.
### Color by Depth: Color gradients indicate the depth of each earthquake, helping to distinguish between shallow and deep seismic events.
### Detailed Popups: Click on any marker to view detailed information about the earthquake, including its location, magnitude, depth, and time of occurrence.
## Legends:
### Size Legend: Explains the relationship between marker size and earthquake magnitude.
### Color Legend: Shows the color gradient used to represent different depths of earthquakes.
